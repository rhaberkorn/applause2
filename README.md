# Applause 2

## Installation

You have to manually build and install LuaJIT v2.1:

    git clone -b v2.1 https://luajit.org/git/luajit.git
    cd luajit
    make
    sudo make install

Furthermore, install the following dependencies:

    sudo apt-get install build-essential libreadline-dev libjack-jackd2-dev \
                         libsndfile1 libasound2 feedgnuplot

To compile the project, type:

    make

Up-to-date documentation is available at the [website](http://rhaberkorn.github.io/applause2).
In case you want to build it manually, install the `lua-ldoc` and `lua-discount` packages and type:

    make doc

The generated documentation will be generated in the `doc/` subdirectory.

## Usage

Start qjackctl.

TODO: How to use jack-plumbing?

    ./applause -o 2

This may require root rights for accessing HID devices.
You may also add the current user to the `input` group.

Example (one channel):

    > Stream.SinOsc(440):play()

You can also run standalone scripts (batch mode), just like the standard Lua interpreter.

# Applause Clients (Editor Integration)

    echo -ne "25   \nStream.SinOsc(440):play()" | socat -,ignoreeof TCP:127.0.0.1:10000"

See also `client.tes` for a [SciTECO](https://github.com/rhaberkorn/sciteco) integration.

# Joysticks and Gamepads

This is supported by EvdevStream().

Alternatively you can use aseqjoy together with `a2jmidid --export-hw`
to expose them as MIDI events.

# Mice

This is supported by EvdevStream().

Alternatively you can use [raton](https://github.com/GModal/raton) together with `a2jmidid --export-hw`
to expose them as MIDI events.

# Other useful programs

* jack_rec, QJackRcd or Audacity to record sessions
* midisnoop for diplaying MIDI events
* jack-keyboard for producing MIDI note events
* [midicontroller](https://sourceforge.net/projects/midicontrol/) for producing MIDI CC events
* MIDI Tracker ???
* evtest to find and test HID devices
* listplugins and analyseplugin to inspect LADSPA plugins
* dssi_list_plugins and dssi_analyse_plugin to inspect DSSI plugins

## Jupyter Console and Notebook

Applause can be run in [Jupyter](https://jupyter.org/) Consoles and even Notebooks thanks to
[ILua](https://github.com/guysv/ilua).
First, install ILua into a Python environment
(see also this [ILua ticket](https://github.com/guysv/ilua/issues/28)):

```bash
git clone https://github.com/guysv/ilua.git --recurse-submodules
cd ilua
python3 -m venv env
. env/bin/activate
pip install twisted==22.10.0 .
```

You can now directly run an Applause Jupyter Console session:

```
cd ~/applause
ilua --lua-interpreter=./applause
```

In order to tweak Applause command line parameters and be independant of the execution directory, use
the included wrapper script.
It also allows passing in additional arguments to Applause, e.g.:

```
APPLAUSE_OPTS="-o 2" ilua --lua-interpreter=./ilua-wrapper.sh
```

You can symlink this to `lua` in the Python environment to make Applause the default
ILua interpreter in this Python environment:

```
ln -s ~/applause/ilua-wrapper.sh env/bin/lua
```

If you would like to launch a Jupyter Notebook (Web UI!), first install the following Pip package:

```
pip install notebook
```

Now launch a web server and follow the onscreen instructions:

```
APPLAUSE_OPTS="-o 2" jupyter notebook --MultiKernelManager.default_kernel_name=lua
```

This works assuming that you symlinked `ilua-wrapper.sh` to `lua` as described above.
An alternative might be to create a custom Jupyter kernel configuration (kernel.json).

Please note the following restrictions/bugs:

* You cannot publicly host the Jupyter Notebook as the sound is generated on the host machine.
* You cannot currently interrupt an endlessly running stream without restarting the kernel
  (see this [ILua bug](https://github.com/guysv/ilua/issues/1)).
* ILua does not work well with our custom Stream:tostring() metamethods
* The output of other functions like Stream:toplot() is garbled.
* You cannot currently output rich text or graphics -
  it would be really cool if we could display SVG generated by gnuplot in notebook cells for instance.
  There is a [workaround](https://github.com/guysv/ilua/issues/5), though.
